#AirwatchRESTWebServicesClientLib

a set of classes to access VMWare Airwatch REST webservices
this project is of essence for other projects I am working on which are (but not limited to) :
AirwatchCommandLine
AirwatchReports
AirwatchAutomation

any help just ask I would be glad to help,
and since I am self-employed I am sure we'll agree to something
by the way I am not working for glory, money is enough.

Procedure to leverage this lib :

-> ask john@mobilutils.eu
